# Yellow Brick Code
This is the repo for the Yellow Brick Code public site, hosted at [https://www.yellowbrickcode.co.uk](https://www.yellowbrickcode.co.uk).

## Running the site locally
### Install Hugo
Install the extended version of Hugo.

On Windows, the easiest way to do this is to install Chocolatey and then install Hugo via that. 

- Install Chocolatey - [https://chocolatey.org/install](https://chocolatey.org/install)
- Open a command window and run `choco install hugo-extended` to install Hugo

### Run the site
Now that Hugo is installed, it's time to get the code and run it locally.

- Clone the repo and initialise submodules for the repo (the theme is a submodule of the repo)
- In a command window, navigate to the src folder for the site (e.g. C:\\Source\ybc-public-site\\src) and run `hugo serve`

In your command window, you should now see something along the lines of:
